PREREQUISITES
=============

Python 2.6+ with the pkg_resources module.

To check if you're good to go, run this:

    python -mpkg_resources

If Python exits without an error, you're good.  However, if you get something like

    ImportError: No module named pkg_resources

then you may need to install the setuptools package.  Here are some methods for 
doing that:

    apt-get install python2-setuptools
    pip install setuptools
